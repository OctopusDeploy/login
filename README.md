# login

A GitHub action to login to your [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/) server.

After successful login, the GitHub Actions environment will be configured so that credentials do not need to be supplied to later Octopus actions (e.g. [`create-release-action`](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/create-release-action)) or the [Octopus CLI](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/cli).

This action supports two ways of logging in:

## OpenID Connect (OIDC)

> Support for OpenID Connect is currently being rolled out to Octopus Cloud and may not be available in your Octopus version just yet.

Using OpenID Connect (OIDC) is the recommended way to login to Octopus from GitHub Actions. It allows the granting of short-lived access tokens for a service account in Octopus that can be used during your GitHub Actions workflow run, without needing to provision or store an API key.

For more information about using OpenID Connect in GitHub Actions see [about security hardening with OpenID Connect](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect).

To login using OIDC:

-   Create a [service account](https://oc.to/ServiceAccount) in Octopus with the permissions required. Note that OIDC is only support for service accounts, not user accounts.
-   Configure an OIDC identity for the service account that matches the GitHub Actions subject claim for your repository and workflow. See the [Octopus OIDC documentation](https://oc.to/ServiceAccountOidcIdentities) for more information.
    -   See [example subject claims](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#example-subject-claims) for more information on the way that subject strings are generated by GitHub Actions.
-   Copy the `Service Account Id` value from the Octopus service account. This will be a GUID.
-   Configure your workflow job to have the `id-token: write` permissions. This allows the `OctopusDeploy/login` action to request an ID token from GitHub as part of the OIDC login process.
-   Add the `OctopusDeploy/login` action to your workflow, specifying the `server` and `service_account_id` inputs.

### Inputs

| Name                 | Description                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `server`             | The URL of your Octopus server. This input is required.                                            |
| `service_account_id` | The id of the service account you wish to login as. This input is required if using OIDC to login. |

### Outputs

| Name           | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `server`       | The URL of your Octopus server that has been logged into. The environment variable `OCTOPUS_URL` will also be set with this value.                          |
| `access_token` | An access token that can be use to authenticate when making API requests. The environment variable `OCTOPUS_ACCESS_TOKEN` will also be set with this value. |

### Example

```yaml
jobs:
  create_release_in_octopus:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Create a release in Octopus
    permissions:
      # You might need to add other permissions here like `contents: read` depending on what else your job needs to do
      id-token: write # This is required to obtain an ID token from GitHub Actions for the job
    steps:
      - name: Login to Octopus
        uses: OctopusDeploy/login@v1
        with:
          server: https://my.octopus.app
          service_account_id: 5be4ac10-2679-4041-a8b0-7b05b445e19e

      - name: Create a release in Octopus
        uses: OctopusDeploy/create-release-action@v3
        with:
          space: Default
          project: My Octopus Project
```

### Support in other GitHub Actions

Using OIDC with other Octopus supplied GitHub Actions is supported in all `v3` versions of actions that connect to Octopus Server, including:

-   [`OctopusDeploy/await-task-action`](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/await-task-action)
-   [`OctopusDeploy/create-release-action`](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/create-release-action)
-   [`OctopusDeploy/deploy-release-action`](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/deploy-release-action)
-   [`OctopusDeploy/deploy-release-tenanted-action`](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/deploy-release-tenanted-action)
-   [`OctopusDeploy/push-build-information-action`](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/push-build-information-action)
-   [`OctopusDeploy/push-package-action`](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/push-package-action)
-   [`OctopusDeploy/run-runbook-action`](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/run-runbook-action)

Using OIDC with the [Octopus CLI](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/cli) is also supported from version `1.6.0` onwards. The CLI can be installed in a workflow using the [`OctopusDeploy/install-octopus-cli-action`](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/install-octopus-cli-action)

## API Key

To login using an API Key:

-   Provision an API key in Octopus. See [How to create an API key](https://octopus.com/docs/octopus-rest-api/how-to-create-an-api-key) for more information. It is recommended that a service account is used instead of a user account.
-   Add the `OctopusDeploy/login` action to your workflow, specifying the `server` and `api_key` inputs.
